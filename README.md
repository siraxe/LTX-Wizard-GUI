## üöÄ Usage

- All required files are located within the workspace folder.
- Models will be downloaded to local `models` folder.
- Add/move transformer to `models/transformer/hg-version-name/hg-version-name.safetensors` if you don't want to redownload it

### Data Preparation

1. Create a new folder for your videos within the `workspace/datasets` directory.
2. In the GUI, navigate to the "Datasets" tab. Your new dataset folder will appear in the dropdown list.
3. Add captions to your videos, either automatically or manually. Completing this step will update the `cap` status to `yes` for your dataset.
4. If necessary, choose a preprocessing model and set the bucket size. (Please refer to the original repository documentation for detailed instructions on these settings).
5. Optionally, add a trigger word for your dataset. You do not need to manually add this word to every caption.
6. Start the preprocessing task. Upon successful completion, the `proc` status for your dataset will be updated.

### Training

1. Navigate to the "Training" tab.
2. Select your desired configuration and the dataset you wish to train on.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the training process.

### Sampling

The "Sampling" subtab allows you to run inference tests on your model during the training process.
